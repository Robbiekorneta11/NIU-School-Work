CSCI 241 - Intermediate Programming - Grade: B
    * A second course in programming techniques with emphasis on design and implementation 
    * of data structures applied to large-scale projects. Topics include static and dynamic 
    * implementation of linear and nonlinear data structures, recursion, searching and sorting 
    * algorithms, and algorithmic complexity analysis.

CSCI 340 - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis - Grade: A
    * Application of analysis and design techniques to nonnumeric algorithms acting on data 
    * structures. Utilization of algorithmic analysis and design criteria in the selection of methods 
    * for data manipulation. Computing projects done in a high-level computing language.
    
CSCI 360 - Computer Programming in Assembler Language
    * In-depth study of assembler language programming on a third-generation computer, 
    * including internal and external subroutines, conditional assembly, and the macro language.
